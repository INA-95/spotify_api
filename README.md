## Project Overview

In this project, I collected my Spotify playlist data. Spotify is a digital music streaming service that allows you access to tons of songs. This project is to help collect Spotify user data to analyze their music tasty. The goal of this project is to collect the data using API that provided officially on their web-site.

This project is divided into three steps:

1. `Deep diving of Spotify API`
   - What is an API?
     The API stands for ‘Application Programming Interface’. Let’s say you visit a restaurant. You order a food and sever deliver the order to kitchen. You can think of ‘the server’ as an API. The server(API) can connect between the customer(Program) and the kitchen(Program).
   - What is Spotify API?
     Spotify API enables the application data that officially developed by Spotify. You can use the API through the website, ‘Spotify for Developers’. They provide documentation as a guidelines and community forum where you can ask some question and report any issues while using the Spotify API. If you want to know more information, please visit [here](https://developer.spotify.com/)
